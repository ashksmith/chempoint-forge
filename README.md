### ☢️ Welcome to Chempoint Forge ☢️
This project is my first attempt at a Necromunda narriative campaign complete with an custom accompanying terrain set designed and built using a laser cutter.

The material I used to make the set was ~3.7mm Plywood. The laser width is 0.05mm. 

The project was designed with FreeCAD and Lightburn. The campaign book was designed in LibreOffice Draw.
