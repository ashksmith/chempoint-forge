### ☢️ Welcome to Chempoint Forge ☢️
This project is my first attempt at a Necromunda narriative campaign complete with an custom accompanying terrain set designed and built using a laser cutter at the Tampere Hacklab.

The project was designed with FreeCAD and Lightburn. The campaign book was designed in LibreOffice Draw.
